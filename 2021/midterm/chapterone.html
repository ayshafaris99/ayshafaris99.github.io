    <p id="text1" data-aos="fade-left"> This is the story of Nijmah Al-Rub, a Middle Eastern woman I met in Amman, Jordan, and a truly inspirational human being, who showed me a little bit of what it means to be a Middle Eastern woman who fights for her own rights and dreams.</p>
</main>

<main id="parttwo">
    <p id="text2" data-aos="fade-up-right"> Nijmah didn’t use to be the social and outgoing woman she is today. She says she used to be very shy and naïve because she had almost no contact with the world outside the 4 walls of her home in Amman, Jordan.</p> 
    <div class= "imagetwo"></div>

<main id="partthree">
<div class= "image3"></div>
    <p id="text3" data-aos="zoom-in-right"> She was married to her husband for 13 years when he suddenly decided to marry another woman while still being married to Nijmah. For some time, both women shared the same room, until it started to create problems between the two.</p> 
</main>

<main id="partfour">
    <p id="text2" data-aos="fade-up-right"> One day, Nijmah decided to leave her husband, taking their daughters with her. For two years she struggled to support herself and her daughters. She received limited help from her brothers and her sister who gave her a small space to live on top of her house.</p> 
    <div class= "imagetwo"></div>

<main id="partfive">
<div class= "imagetwo"></div>
    <p id="text2" data-aos="zoom-in"> Nijmah reached the point where she could no longer bring bread home, the only thing she could afford, and her sister could not support her anymore with the $50 JOD (Jordanian Dinars – around $70) per month she was giving. At that point, she made the hard decision to go back to her husband.</p>
