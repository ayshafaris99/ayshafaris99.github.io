            <p id="text2" data-aos="zoom-in">She is now a hotel owner, and soon to be the proud owner of a second hotel – right in front of the Roman Amphitheatre. (

                During my stay at the Abbasi Palace Hotel, I received the warmest welcoming I’ve ever had with hot tea and with a “welcome home” greeting – showing Nijmah’s charming character towards guests. The hotel might offer basic (yet good) budget accommodations that range between private and shared rooms, but it shines with the warm treatment of the staff towards the guests, and vice-versa. </p> 
        </div>
        <div id="part13">
            <p id="text2" data-aos="zoom-in">You can always see Nijmah around the gathering area and smoking area socializing with people and making sure everything is ok. She’s attentive enough to dedicate time to chat with you, socialize, and make you feel more at home. You can see her genuine passion for life when you speak with her.</p> 
        </div>
        <div id="part13">
            <p id="text2" data-aos="zoom-in">The hotel has an interesting yet good visual character. You can see and feel the stitched history of how this hotel was put together when you hang around in the common areas; looking at the traditional Jordanian decoration, the furniture, the art, and more. The evolving combination of elements gives the place an inviting cozy environment.</p> 
        </div>
        <div id="part13">
            <p id="text2" data-aos="zoom-in">The hotel is well located in Quraish Street in the center of Downtown Amman, just a 5-minute walk from the Roman Amphitheatre and The Citadel (the two biggest landmarks in Downtown Amman) and close to many local shops and restaurants – like Rainbow Street</p> 
        </div>
        <div id="part13">
            <p id="text2" data-aos="zoom-in">I also found interesting that Nijmah, being an orphan herself, donates the tips received at the hotel towards the orphans in Amman. She also dedicates her time to teach them and to help them improve their lives and have a passion for it. </p> 
        </div>
        <div id="part13">
            <p id="text2" data-aos="zoom-in">Nijmah showed me how anyone can do anything in life if they work really hard for it and have the passion to achieve it.
                <br>
                Even if you start low and see many obstacles ahead, there is hope if you decide to take control of your life by choosing what you really want and by fighting for it.
                <br> 
                For me, Nijmah is a role model, not only for Middle Eastern women, but for everyone. </p>
