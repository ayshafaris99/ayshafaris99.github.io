        <p id="text2" data-aos="zoom-in-up"> Once back, and in no time, her husband kicked her out of the house but kept the children. On her own, Nijmah found a small place with barely a roof. Anytime it rained, it poured into the room.</p> 
</main>
<main id="partseven">
        <p id="text2" data-aos="fade-up-right"> She started selling perfumes on the streets to make her living, and when she made enough spare money, she bought a TV (very small TV) for $20 JOD ($28).  The purpose of the TV?  To sit down to watch TV after her very long days on the street, just to learn English. </p> 
</main>
<main id="parteight">
        <p id="text9" data-aos="fade-up-right"> Eventually, she started working as a receptionist at a hotel that was not doing well at the time – receiving a salary of $150 JOD ($210) per month. With her charms and personality, she brought the place to life and turned the hotel into the number one hotel in Jordan. </p> 
</main>
<main id="partnine">
        <p id="text2" data-aos="fade-up-right"> She wanted to move up the ladder and after a few years, she asked for a raise/position. It was denied. At that moment she took another gamble in life by quitting her stable job. She wanted to have a better control of her future and her professional life.  </p> 
</main>
<main id="partten">
        <p id="text2" data-aos="fade-up-right"> Soon after, Nijmah started her own small business of sewing and selling clothes. Every month, she hid $50 JOD ($70) of the money earned and saved it for bigger plans in the future… being a hotel owner.</p> 
</main>

<main id="part11">
        <p id="text9" data-aos="fade-up-right"> After a few years, she rented an old building for $2,500 JOD ($3500) to turn it into a hotel – Abbasi Palace Hotel. She had no customers, no furniture, nothing. By in shaa’Allah, God’s will –as she likes to say– she was contacted by a tour operator who had a group of 100 tourists at the border and was about to arrive in Amman.</p> 
</main>
<main id="part12">
        <p id="text2" data-aos="fade-up-left"> They would pay $3,000 JOD ($4200) to stay in her hotel (which still had nothing in it). She took the risk of saying yes, and in the time it took the tourists to reach from the border to Amman, she did the most she could to buy beds, furniture, lamps, and everything necessary to fit the hotel. It turned out to be a good gamble, after all.</p> 
</main>
<main id="part13">
        <p id="text2" data-aos="zoom-in">Eventually, the same operator contacted her with another group of 100 tourists, and with that group’s money she bought more furniture for the public areas and kept revamping the building.At the time she couldn’t hire anyone, so she was doing everything, from housekeeping to cooking, to reservations, everything! As time passed, her business became a stable venture and she began to hire people to run the place like a proper hotel. </p>
